### 1 - Average of subaaray
Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.
### 2 - Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k,’ find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size ‘k’.
### 3 - Smallest Subarray with a given sum
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.
### 4 - Longest Substring with maximum K Distinct Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.
### 5 - Fruits into Baskets
Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

You can start with any tree, but you can’t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
### 6 - Longest Substring with Distinct Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring, which has all distinct characters
### 7 - Longest Substring with Same Letters after Replacement
Given a string with lowercase letters only, if you are allowed to replace no more than k letters with any letter, find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.
### 8 - Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement
Given an array containing 0s and 1s, if you are allowed to replace no more than ‘k’ 0s with 1s, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray having all 1s.
### 9 - Permutation in a String
Given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the characters of the string. For example, “abc” has the following six permutations:
(abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba)

If a string has ‘n’ distinct characters, it will have n! permutations.
### 10 - String Anagrams
Given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

Every anagram is a permutation of a string. As we know, when we are not allowed to repeat characters while finding permutations of a string, we get N! permutations (or anagrams) of a string having N characters. For example, here are the six anagrams of the string “abc”:
(abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba)

Write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string
### 11 - Smallest Window containing Substring
Given a string and a pattern, find the smallest substring in the given string which has all the characters of the given pattern.
### 12 -  Words Concatenation
Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any overlapping of words. It is given that all words are of the same length.
